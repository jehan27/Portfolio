          <p>No one knows for sure who invented the white macadamia nut cookie. White chocolate chips were invented by Nestle in the 30’s, but macadamia nuts weren’t available to the public until 1975. Sometime after that these delicious flavors found each other, and history was made. </p>

      <h2>FAQS about this cookie</h2>
      <p>These cookies are seriously delicious, but sometimes it can be fussy. So here the tips to make it for the first time or next time:</p>
      
      <h3> COOKIES ARE SPREADING TOO MUCH.</h3>
      <p>-Cookie dough is warm.</p>
      <p>-You didn’t refrigerate the cookie dough. You should refrigerate the cookie so the moisture will be absorbed by the dry ingredients. Not refrigerating the cookie will make it bigger.</p>
      <p>-You measured an ingredient.  If you try reducing ingredients (like sugars) or adding more, it will affect your cookies’ spread.</p>
      <p>-Your cookie dough balls might be too big – bigger balls spread more.</p>
      <p>-You added less mix-ins – the fewer white chocolate chips/nuts in a cookie, the more likely they are to spread more.</p>

      <h3> COOKIES DIDN’T SPREAD ENOUGH.</h3>
      <p>The number one culprit here is going to be over-measuring the flour. A food scale is always most accurate.</p>
      <p>Cookie dough could be a little cool.</p>
      <p>Mix ins – if one cookie has a lot of mix ins, they may stay in a mound in the center of the cookie, so it ends up not spreading as well. I know – a pain.</p>
      <p>Did you reduce the sugar at all, or mis measure it? That makes a difference. Sugar adds moisture, which adds to the cookies’ spread.</p>
      <p>Did you make smaller cookie balls? They will likely spread less. Try flattening them out a bit prior to baking.</p>

      <h3>Saying thankyou to our frontliners by giving them a cookie</h3>
      
      <p>In early 2020, there was a pandemic that spread in the world that took some people's lives. Almost all the countries in the world got affected by this sickness. Some countries defeated this pandemic, but some countries are still in the lockdown situation trying to fight this COVID-19. As a person, we all don’t know when we are going back to our normal lives, but right know the only thing to prevent this pandemic is to stay at home, pray and not going into public places. Staying at home is getting harder and harder because we just do the same things everyday like watching tv, eat, sleep and repeat. There are some people who will not do the same thing in their everyday life, but they will choose to learn new things. We all know that our front liners are risking their lives for us and doing everything to save some people's lives. We all know by giving them a simple greeting, smile or food their day will be better. In this pandemic, it teaches us to do something good for others. It’s also a good chance to show the new generation that showing a gratitude to the community is important.
